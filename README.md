# Getting Started With the Vue Toolbar Component
A quick-start Vue project showing how to start with the Syncfusion Vue Toolbar Component. Also learn, how to set prefix icons and separators, change the display mode, and add input-based components to the toolbar using the template option.

Vue Toolbar is a feature-rich component that provides an interface for selecting a command from a collection of commands. Its features include different orientations, responsive modes (scrollable and pop-up), templating, and button alignment based on priority.

It allows customizing the command appearance with HTML elements like images, text buttons, toggle buttons, select boxes, text boxes, and autocomplete. This helps you make toolbar search boxes and toolbar menu-like applications. And provides data binding support, rendered based on a JSON array collection of properties such as text, type, and alignment. Data binding can be achieved by forming an array collection of items.
